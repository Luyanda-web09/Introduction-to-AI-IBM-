In healthcare, it aids in tailored treatments and simulates surgeries, while in education, it creates customized learning materials.

The differences between traditional AI and generative AI, highlighting the evolution of AI systems.

Traditional AI Framework

In traditional AI, data is stored in a repository, which includes various types of information like tables, images, and documents.
An analytics platform processes this data to build predictive models, which are then applied in applications to take actions, such as preventing customer churn.
Feedback Loop in Traditional AI

A feedback loop is essential for traditional AI, allowing the system to learn from past predictions and improve its models over time.
This process helps refine the AI's accuracy by learning from both successes and mistakes.
Generative AI Framework

Generative AI starts with vast amounts of external data, not limited to an organization's internal repository, and utilizes large language models (LLMs).
The prompting and tuning layer customizes these general models to specific business needs, while the application layer serves the AI's purpose, similar to traditional AI.
Overall, the architecture of generative AI is fundamentally different due to the scale of data and models involved, necessitating a new approach to AI development.

The current state of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and whether we have achieved true AI, particularly in the context of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

Understanding AI and AGI

AI is defined as the simulation of intelligent behavior in computers, but true AGI, which would match human intelligence, has not yet been achieved.
Examples like calculators and chess-playing computers illustrate that while they can perform specific tasks, they do not possess true intelligence.
Turing Test and Its Implications

The Turing Test is introduced as a measure of AI, where a computer's responses are indistinguishable from a human's in conversation.
Although some chatbots have reportedly passed the Turing Test, the bar for what constitutes true intelligence remains subjective and often feels low.
Current Developments and Future Prospects

The conversation highlights the rapid advancements in AI technology, suggesting we are closer to achieving AGI than ever before.
Despite progress, the speakers agree that we have not yet reached a point where AI can fully replicate human-like intelligence across diverse tasks.
